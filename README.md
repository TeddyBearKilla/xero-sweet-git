# This is XeroLinux's Sweet Rice

### Disclaimer

I would like to clarify one very important aspect of ricing. We use custom themes in every one of our rices, and those might not get updated very often, if at all by their respective developers/artists, which might result in some parts of the system and apps not to get themed correctly. That, my friends, is unfortunately out of our hands.

### Performance :

This rice as with most of our rices has been throughly optimized for best performance on higher-end systems.. Although it might work on lower-end ones, for better performance I do not recommend that you use it there. So please do not report any performance issues.

### Installation

First you will need to be on **XeroLinux** in order for this to work, can't be on any other distro. With that out of the way, all you need to do in order to apply this beautiful rice, is to launch our tool from the Dock if you haven't removed it already or from the applications menu by searching for "Xero".  Just make sure you have the latest version, update if you don't. Once that's done, head on over to **Post-Install System Config** there you will see a button labeled **XeroLinux Rices**, just click on it and select this rice from the list and watch it do its magic. You will need to reboot for it to be applied correctly. Enjoy ;)

### Side-Note :

> If you apply this rice and something goes wrong, well, that's not a fault of our own, it's just KDE being what it is, to remedy the situation, you are kindly requested to re-apply the rice again, that should fix it. And if you apply one rice, then another on top of it, same thing might happen thus same solution applies. Sorry about that but sometimes KDE can be a pain.. I still love it though ;)

### Support

I didn't work on this rice alone, with the majority of the work, especially the wallpaper, Grub and overall consistency which were all done by my good friend and brother [@TeddyBearKilla](https://github.com/TeddyBearKilla), so please feel free to show him some love by buying him a [**Coffee**](https://ko-fi.com/teddybearkilla) or two...

### Your Settings

Keep in mind that it will backup some app settings & all system ones before applying and overriding them with new ones, you will be able to restore what you need from the backup, so please do not report that. You have been warned. In case of any issues please find us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Xg6T78ahtK). Best of luck !

### Applying Theme/Rice Updates

When you initially apply the rice, you will be getting latest theme/rice code in straight from source, but in case there are updates to the underlying themes or rice itself, as I keep applying various optimizations, and want to apply them, well, that will be difficult without having to re-apply the rice, which will replace any and/or all your own modifications should you have applied any. Unfortunately it is what it is. Only do it if and when you feel confident enough and know how to restore your settings from backup afterwards. Sorry about that. I hope that covers that lol ;)

## Script will do the following steps :

- Create a cbackup of your ~/.config folders
- Download and install necessary packages if needed...
- Override your settings and files with this rice's.
- Install and apply New Grub theme.
